# Brenner Data

Repo to convert original Brenner-XML files into some valid TEI/XML and pubish the latter.

* copy needed files from [br_texts/BR](https://gitlab.oeaw.ac.at/acdh-ch/ace/der-brenner/brenner) into `brenner`
* run `ant` to convert files from `brenner` into TEI/XML and store new created files into `editions/{volume-id}/{orig-filename}.xml`

currently no actual data will be checked into the repo due to ongoing work on proper TEI conversion.
